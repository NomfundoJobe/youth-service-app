# youth-service-app
Overview

Creating an app to encourage youth to be proactive about attending Friday youth services that will help them to engage more in participating in the youth service. I am using Streamlit to implement the interactive features and user interface elements of my app. The Youth Service App is a web application designed to manage seat and food reservations for youth services. It provides an easy-to-use interface for youth members to RSVP and ensure their spot at events.

Features
    RSVP Management: Allows youth members to reserve seats for upcoming youth services.
    Motivation: Inspiring messages to highlight the value of attending youth services.
    Countdown & RSVP: Countdown to the next service and RSVP with motivational prompts.
    Engagement: Polls, surveys, and an interactive calendar for active participation.
    Feedback & Sharing: Submit feedback and share experiences on social media.
    Rewards: Earn badges and rewards for participation.
    Community: Chat forum and community events to foster a sense of belonging.
